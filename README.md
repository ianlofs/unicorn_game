##unicorn_game

This is a little javascript and html5 canvas game. This definitely only works in Chrome right now.


To get started you must have node as well as webpack and webpack-dev-server installed globally:

```sh
npm install
webpack --watch
```

In another terminal:
```sh
npm start
```

Go to localhost:8080 and click on app, the game will then start up.
